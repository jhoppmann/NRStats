/*
 * This file is used to set credentials and connection information for the
 * database scripts.
 *
 * The $dbHost property is the address (or IP) of the host database, e. g.
 * 'localhost' or '172.217.23.142'. If the standard port 3306 is used, no port
 * needs to be added to the address.
 *
 * The $dbName property is the database's name. Choose any name you like.
 *
 * $user is the database user used to connect. The user needs to have the
 * necessary rights to read and create entries on the database. If you're not
 * sure how to do this, consult the manual for MySQL's GRANT command.
 *
 * $password is the user's password in plain text. Don't worry, since this file
 * is a .php file, no one that only has access to your web server will be able
 * to read it.
 *
 * Once you finish entering the data, rename this file to config.inc.php and
 * you'll be able to run the install script.
